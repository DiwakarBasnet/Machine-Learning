# Machine-Learning
Machine learning algorithm techniques can be broadly classified into 3 types;
* Supervised Machine Learning - Task Driven (Regression and Classification)
* Unsupervised Machine Learning - Data Driven (Clustering)
* Reinforcement Machine Learning - Learning from mistakes (Reward & Punishment)

# Supervised Learning;
Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. 
The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.
It can be separated into two types of problems;<br>
1. Regression: It is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections.
2. Classification: It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusion on how those entities should be labeled.

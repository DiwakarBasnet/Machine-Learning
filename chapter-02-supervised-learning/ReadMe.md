# Supervised Learning:

Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. 
The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.
It can be separated into two types of problems;<br>
2. Classification: It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusion on how those entities should be labeled.

## 1. Regression:

It is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is used as an approach to predict continuous outcomes in predictive modelling. Machine learninig regression generally involves plotting a line of best fit through the data points. Regression models could be model that forecasts salary changes, house prices or retail sales. There are a range of different approaches used in machine learning to perform regression. 
Some of the most common regresssion techniques in machine learning can be grouped into following types of regression analysis;

* ### Simple linear regression
It is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables; one is independent variable and other is dependent variable. It is a technique which plots a straight line within data points to minimise error between the line and data points.

* ### Multiple linear regression
It is a technique that uses more than one independent variables to predict the outcome of a dependent variable.
